Loporrits are a race of arcane beings in Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker who were created by Hydaelyn after she sealed Zodiark. Ever since the sundering of Etheirys, the Loporrits have been tasked with preparing mankind's possible future of escaping their star before the coming of the Final Days.The Loporrits are diminutive with round pointy rabbit ears and blue cloudy eyes, much like that of those who serve as vessels for Hydaelyn, like Minfilia Warde. They dress in white and blue robes, with a brown sash tied with a moon buckle, and matching brown gloves and boots. While most Loporrits have white fur, Tuneingway has pink fur and different colored clothing.Loporrits adore carrots.
